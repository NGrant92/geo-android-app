### Description:

Geocaching is a form of Orienteering or 'treasure hunting' that is run and maintained by the players
themselves. The players can put a "cache" wherever they think is appropriate and set a location to it
online, others can go visit it and usually leave notes for the next visitors.

This app allows users to create/update/delete their own caches while also being able to view other
